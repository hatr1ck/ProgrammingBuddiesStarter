Hello!
You landed on a ProgrammingBuddies() community project. Currently we working on a Target clone with MERN stack.

**We are learning here, so no pixel perfect and sutff, close enough is enough. We start from more surface stuff (like home page, and basic routes), and go from it**
**The motive is to have something to show, like "I did that with the bunch of other people", the exact copy will take too long time, do what you can, no pressure.**

**DM hatr1ck on discord if you need access to this repo**


**Setup:**

### `npm ci`

### `npm start`

**Links:**

[Discord](https://discord.gg/DbY7Fb846y)

[Trello](https://trello.com/b/Xl0BgMSj/project-ecommerce)

[Netlify live link](https://confident-brattain-8532df.netlify.app/)

**Reasons behind:**

1. Learn with/from others.
2. Find same minded people.
3. Learn how to work together in something bigger then to-do list or weather app.

**How it works:**

1. Compare original Target site vs the one we have in this repo.
2. Find something that is missing and what you would like to make.
3. You tell others in [Trello](https://trello.com/b/Xl0BgMSj/project-ecommerce) what part of the project you would like to claim.
4. If nobody already doing this same thing you can start working on it.

**FAQ:**

Q: How close to original should it be.

A: Not pixel perfect for sure, but close enough.

Q: Can I get access to repo?

A: DM hatr1ck on discord.

Q: What if I am new to web development.

A: You can find something very basic to do, like a navbar, or change someones css color if it is a little of, it's all good.

Q: How close I should stick to the tech stack.

A: If you want to add new library you should ask others, but if you hate TypeScript or SCSS for example, you can just do things in vanilla react/js/css

**WhoAmI:**

I am wannabe web-dev who tired of joining groups on reddit/discord where people just post their bio with intentions and receive silence after.

**WhoIAmNot:**

Moses who can guide everyone to what they should do, I am a beginner, and I can't help everyone, I just make an initiative and hope we can make something from it.

**Rules**:

1. Don't be an ass.
2. Keep thing live and open, chat, ask, help others.
