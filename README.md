Hello!
You landed on a ProgrammingBuddies() community project. Currently we working on a Target clone with MERN stack.

**Setup:**

### `npm ci`

### `npm start`

**Links:**

[Discord](https://discord.gg/DbY7Fb846y)

[Trello](https://trello.com/b/Xl0BgMSj/project-ecommerce)

[Netlify live link](https://confident-brattain-8532df.netlify.app/)

**Reasons behind:**

1. Learn with/from others.
2. Find same minded people.
3. Learn how to work together in something bigger then to-do list or weather app.

**How it works:**

1. Compare original Target site vs the one we have in this repo.
2. Find something that is missing and what you would like to make.
3. You tell others in [Trello](https://trello.com/b/Xl0BgMSj/project-ecommerce) what part of the project you would like to claim.
4. If nobody already doing this same thing you can start working on it.

**FAQ:**

Q: How close to original should it be.

A: Not pixel perfect for sure, but close enough.

Q: Can I get access to repo?

A: DM hatr1ck on discord.

Q: What if I am new to web development.

A: You can find something very basic to do, like a navbar, or change someones css color if it is a little of, it's all good.

Q: How close I should stick to the tech stack.

A: If you want to add new library you should ask others, but if you hate TypeScript or SCSS for example, you can just do things in vanilla react/js/css

**WhoAmI:**

I am wannabe web-dev who tired of joining groups on reddit/discord where people just post their bio with intentions and receive silence after.

**WhoIAmNot:**

Moses who can guide everyone to what they should do, I am a beginner, and I can't help everyone, I just make an initiative and hope we can make something from it.

**Rules**:

1. Don't be an ass.
2. Keep thing live and open, chat, ask, help others.
